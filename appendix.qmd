### Usage and Revisions

1. **About Me Section:**  
   - Mostly retained from the LLM draft with minor edits to improve readability and include precise terminology like "sustainable urban development" and "technical precision."
   
2. **Education and Experience Sections:**  
   - Expanded on the draft to include realistic dates, locations, and company names.  
   - Rephrased bullet points to be more action-oriented and quantifiable where possible.
   
3. **Key Skills & Contact:**  
   - Skills were formatted as badges for visual clarity.  
   - Contact information was updated to include professional links (LinkedIn, GitHub) and formatted consistently.

**Commentary:**  
The LLM-generated draft provided a solid foundation and structure. I revised it to match a professional portfolio style, added specificity, improved formatting, and integrated it into the final Quarto HTML layout for visual appeal and accessibility.


*My commentary (what I used and changed):*  
- first I used the LLM to outline my portfolio sections.  
- LLM generated the dummy data for my portfolio. so once i have an idea and outline i replaced dummy data with my personal informations.  
- I cited Quarto documentation and any other sources used.
